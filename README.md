# This is a repository for the 'Data Structures' class of the Bachelor's in Computational Physics program at IFSC-USP
It contains all the projects completed during the semester. Each project was designed to address simple problems in C, using data structures. An 'Instructions.txt' file is included for each project to help you understand what was done.
